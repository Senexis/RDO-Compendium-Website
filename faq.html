                                The bot got started in June of 2020. At that time the bot started to get a few basic
                                functionalities.

                                The bot was developed by Senexis (also known as Bob Ross on Discord). He is currently

                                widely known yet.

                                In general, the answer to this is yes to be able to keep the bot up and running.
                                However, exceptions can be made in certain circumstances. In light of recent global
                                events it is perfectly reasonable to want to cancel your support. Any support you can
                                offer is appreciated.

                                If you decide you want to stop supporting the bot for any reason, you'll lose access to
                                Premium at the start of the next month. So say you stop supporting at the 14th, you'll
                                keep Premium until the 1st of the next month.

                                This can have multiple causes. Perhaps the bot doesn't have proper permission to talk in

                                and slower, starting with 10 seconds between commands.

                                When the bot can't find something, it doesn't neccesarily mean that the bot doesn't have
                                the information you're looking for. You can try asking the bot differently. If you are
                                using the bot in different language, it could be that the searching just doesn't detect
                                certain characters. Try using more precise spelling.
