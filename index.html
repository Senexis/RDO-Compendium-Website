        <p>RDO Compendium is a bot that allows you to locate different types of collectibles, missions, herbs, animals,
          shops, treasures, and more within Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;2 and Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Online. If this
          interests you at all, <a
            href="{{ site.invite_link }}"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">invite the bot</a>, follow the instructions, then type
          <code>!help</code> to get started!</code></p>
        <h5>Translations</h5>
        <p>As the bot is starting to be used by more and more users around the world, we're looking for translators to
          help us reach a broader audience. While most of the game content has already been translated, command
          responses and the like have mostly been left untouched. To allow users who are not native English speakers,
          we've decided to open up translation efforts.</p>
        <p>If you are adept at a foreign language, feel free to help translate the bot by visiting <a
            href="{{ site.translate_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the translation
            page</a>, signing up for an account, and translating. All your efforts are greatly appreciated by us and our
          audience.</p>
        <h5>Patreon</h5>
        <p><a href="{{ site.patreon_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The bot has a
            Patreon page</a>. Thank you for wanting to support the bot! Sincerely, it helps a lot that you even
          considered donating today. This bot was made by just me, and so far quite a few cups of tea have gone into
          making this bot work like it does. It may not always be perfect, but it means a lot to me that you appreciated
          it enough to consider making a donation. Thanks a lot! <i>- Bob Ross</i></p>
        <h5>More information coming soon...</h5>
        <p>As you may be able to tell, it's a little empty here. For right now, this is all she wrote. However, expect
          to see more information such as guides, support articles and more in the near future. If you want to keep up
          to date, feel free to <a href="{{ site.support_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the
            bot's Discord</a>. If you're more of a Tweeter, make sure to follow <a
            href="{{ site.twitter_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RDOCompendium</a> on
          Twitter for updates.</p>
