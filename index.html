        <p>RDO Compendium is a bot that allows you to locate different types of collectibles, missions, herbs, animals,
          shops, treasures, and more within Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;2 and Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Online. If this
          interests you at all, <a href="{{ site.invite_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">invite the
            bot</a>, follow the instructions, then type <code>!help</code> or visit our <a data-test="/"
            href="/guides/basics/">commands guide</a> and <a data-test="/" href="/guides/settings/">settings guide</a> if
          you want to read more about the bot right now!</code>
        </p>
        <h5>Translations</h5>
        <p>As the bot is starting to be used by more and more users around the world, we're looking for translators to
          help us reach a broader audience. While most of the game content has already been translated, command
          responses and the like have mostly been left untouched. To allow users who are not native English speakers,
          we've decided to open up translation efforts.</p>
        <p>If you are adept at a foreign language, feel free to help translate the bot by visiting <a
            href="{{ site.translate_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the translation
            page</a>, signing up for an account, and translating. All your efforts are greatly appreciated by us and our
          audience.</p>
        <h5>Patreon</h5>
        <p><a href="{{ site.patreon_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The bot has a
            Patreon page</a>. Thank you for wanting to support the bot! Sincerely, it helps a lot that you even
          considered donating today. This bot was made by just me, and so far quite a few cups of tea have gone into
          making this bot work like it does. It may not always be perfect, but it means a lot to me that you appreciated
          it enough to consider making a donation. Thanks a lot! <i>- Senexis</i></p>
        <h5>Contact</h5>
        <p>If you ever need help with the bot because you hit an issue you can't solve, we're here to help. Please don't
          hesitate one second to reach out to us through our various platforms, like the <a
            href="{{ site.support_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support Server</a> or directly on
          Twitter <a href="{{ site.twitter_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RDOCompendium</a>. We
          might not always immediately respond to your query due to silly things like timezones, but once we read it we
          will help you until your issue is resolved or your question has been answered. We are here for you.</p>
